/**
 * React hook that exposes an always-up-to-date list of registered views and the
 * currently active view id.
 *
 * The hook listens to the internal ViewCreated / ViewDeleted / ViewChanged
 * events that `ViewManager` fires via the viewer event-bus, therefore any
 * component that consumes this hook will automatically re-render whenever the
 * view list changes or another view becomes active â€“ no manual `refreshTrigger`
 * bookkeeping is required.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```tsx
 * const { viewList, currentViewId } = useViews();
 * ```
